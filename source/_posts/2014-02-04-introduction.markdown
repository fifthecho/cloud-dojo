Welcome to Cloud Dojo. The purpose behind this site is to act as a source of information for Cloud Computing, Cloud Storage, and all other technologies related to the Cloud Computing world (IT Automation, Configuration Management, API programming, etc.).

Our first several posts will focus primarily on the history of Cloud Computing and provide definitions for common terminology that will be used in future posts.

After the foundation is build, there will be a number of posts and videos featuring different Cloud Computing technologies. A heavy focus will be placed on Apache CloudStack and Amazon Web Services (AWS), as those are the platforms which I am most familiar with, however I will explore OpenStack and post my discoveries as I explore those technologies as well.

The Cloud Dojo project is being written in Octopress and the code for the site is located at [GitHub](https://github.com/fifthecho/cloud-dojo) and I will be happy to accept contributions from anyone wanting to provide content for the Cloud Dojo.

I hope that this site will provide useful and informative and welcome you along the journey of discovering the world of Cloud Computing.
